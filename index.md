I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my love of guitars. I have been playing guitar for 45 years, since I got y first guitar at 11 years old
 - I started playing classical guitar in school.
 - At 14 I decided to leave classical style and played acoustic guitar.
 - Up until 40, I continued my acoustic guitar until I bought my first electric (Fender Stratocaster)
 - I have bought 2 bass guitars and a further 7 electric guitars and two other acoustics
