I have always loved music, and wanted to learn piano from as early as I could remember. My parents could not afford to buy one, but generously bought me a classical guitar when I was 11 years old. This started my love for guitar.
I learned clasical guitar alongside music theory and loved the idea of making music. However, as a teenager, classical music was not what interested me. At 16 I gave up the classical pursuit and started playing acoustic guitar.
I developed reasonable skill as an acoustic guitar player. I bought a Yamaha acoustic guitar at 16, and then when I was about 29 years old, got my dream acoustic guitar, a handbuilt Irish guitar by George Lowden.
I continued playing acoustic until I was 40, and then in a mid-life crisis, bought my first electric guitar on Ebay, a Fender Stratocaster.
I got an old Fender Squier bass being thrown away, and fixed it up, to help play in a group that had no bass player in my 40s.
I wanted to try a few other of the main types of guitar - a Les Paul (only an Epiphone as I couldn't afford the Gibson). A Fender Baja Telecaster. A Line6 James Tyler Variax. A PRS 24 SE. A Hagstrom. I also traded my Mexican made original Stratocaster for a Fender Elite Stratocaster.
I traded an older Fender Strat for a new Overwater 5 string bass guitar.
For my 50th birthday, I bought an additional new Lowden 025C.
So the story continues... somehow I think it isn't finished yet.
